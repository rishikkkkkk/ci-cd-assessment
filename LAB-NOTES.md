# Task 1 – Hello World Workflow
## Purpose of the Workflow:

The purpose of this workflow is to demonstrate a basic GitHub Actions pipeline. It verifies that automation is correctly set up by triggering on every push and executing a simple command

## Key Configuration Details:
1.  Workflow File Location
```.github/workflows/hello.yml```

2.  Workflow Trigger Event
```
on:
  push:
```
3.  Job Configuration
````
jobs:
  hello-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
````

4.  Job Step Executed
```
steps:
  - name: Print Hello Message
    run: echo "Hello GitHub Actions!"
```

# Task 2 – Basic Docker Build & Push 
## Purpose of the Workflow

The purpose of this workflow is to automate the process of building a Docker image from the application source code and pushing it to Docker Hub. This ensures consistent image creation and versioning using GitHub Actions.

## Key Configuration Details:
1.  .dockerignore: Prevents unnecessary files from being included in the Docker build context.

# Task 3 – Shared Workflow Repository & Release 
## Purpose of the Workflow

To create a reusable GitHub Actions workflow that standardizes Docker build and push logic across repositories. This improves consistency, reusability, and maintainability by centralizing CI/CD logic.

## Implementation:
1.  Create a repo:
``` shared-workflows```
2.  Create Reusable Workflow

3.  Created a call workflow with develop branch and main

4.  Create a caller workflow that uses the reusable workflow from the Workflow 
Repository release tag.

5.  On push to develop branch → call the shared workflow to tag the image as 
staging-<commit_sha>.

6.  On push to main branch → call the shared workflow to tag the image as 
prod-<version>.

# Task 4 – Security & Notifications 
## Purpose of the Workflow

### Enhance the reusable Docker workflow by:
1.  Adding security scanning (detect vulnerabilities)
2.  Failing builds on high/critical issues
3.  Sending Slack notifications on success/failure

## Implementation:
1.  Extend the reusable workflow in the Workflow Repository with: 
    Image scanning (e.g., Trivy or Snyk). 
    Fail the pipeline if high/critical vulnerabilities are found.

2.  Add a Slack notification step in the reusable workflow: 
    On success → send a message that the image was built and pushed. 
    On failure → send a message with the error summary.

3.  Configure Slack credentials as GitHub Secrets. 
We will create a slack webhook and paste it to ```SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL``` in the Github Secrets.
